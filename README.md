This project was developed as part of the Office Master Workshop, where I learned how to create professional and interactive dashboards in under 30 minutes using Power BI. Through this workshop, I gained skills in data preparation, including cleaning and transforming raw data and designing visually appealing dashboards with interactive elements such as slicers, filters, and dynamic charts. Additionally, I learned the art of storytelling with data, enabling me to present key findings effectively and support decision-making. This project is a practical application of the techniques and concepts I acquired during the workshop.
